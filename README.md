# GettingAndCleaningData
## A Tidy Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Submitted artifacts include:
1. A tidy data set   
2. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
3. This README.md explaining how all the scripts work and how they are connected.
